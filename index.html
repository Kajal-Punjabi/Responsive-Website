        <p class="sectionTag text-big"> The End of Illiteracy is Here</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, 
            skills, and character traits. There are many debates about its 
            precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A 
            further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change
             in the student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role
             of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination.
             Such precise definitions often succeed at characterizing the most typical 
             forms of education. But they are criticized because there are 
             counterexamples.[10][11][2] These difficulties have led some theorists to 
             develop less precise concepts. Some of them are based on family resemblance. 
             This means that all the forms of education are similar to each other. 
             But they need not share a set of essential features that all of them have 
             in common.[1][12][13] Some theorists claim that the term "education" is 
             context-dependent. This implies that its meaning varies depending on the 
             situation in which it is used.[2] Having a clear idea of what the term means
             is important to correctly identify forms of education. 
             It also matters when trying to measure or improve them. 
             Education can be characterized from the teacher's or the student's 
             perspective. Teacher-centered definitions focus on the perspective and role 
             of the teacher. They may claim, for example, that education is the 
             transmission of knowledge and skills in a morally appropriate way. 
             Student-centered definitions, on the other hand, see education from the 
             student's experience in the learning process. For example, they may define 
             it as a process that transforms and enriches their subsequent experience.
             Definitions taking both perspectives into account are also possible. 
             This can take the form of describing the process as the shared experience 
             of a common world. This shared experience involves discovery as well as posing and solving problems.

    <p class="sectionTag text-big"> Transforming Education in India</p>
    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The definition of education has been 
        explored by theorists from various fields.[1][2][3] Many agree that 
        education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving certain goals, which 
        include the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.
         However, there is extensive debate regarding its exact nature beyond these 
         general features. Some theorists view education primarily as a process that 
         occurs during educational events such as schooling, teaching, and learning.
         Others perceive it not as a process but as the product resulting from this 
         process, emphasizing the mental states and dispositions of educated persons.
         Additionally, the term may also refer to an academic field that studies the 
         methods, processes, and social institutions involved in teaching and learning.
         The term "education" is derived from the Latin words educare, meaning 
         "bring up, rear, educate", primarily related to the mind, 
        and educere, meaning "bring out, lead forth", and refers to the bodily level.
         Many thick and prescriptive conceptions rely on the aims of education to 
         explain their view. This means that they see education as an activity that 
         tries to achieve certain aims.[19][20][21] These aims can be classified 
         into different categories. There is one category for epistemic goods, like 
         knowledge and understanding. Another category covers skills, like 
         rationality and critical thinking. Additionally, 
        there are character traits, like kindness and honesty.

        Many thick and prescriptive conceptions rely on the aims of education 
        to explain their view. This means that they see education as an activity 
        that tries to achieve certain aims.[19][20][21] These aims can be

        like rationality and critical thinking. Additionally, there are character 
        traits, like kindness and honesty.[15]

Some theorists focus on a single overarching purpose of education and see
 the more specific aims as means to this end.[22][20] For example, they may 
 claim that socialization is the aim of education. This means that education is
  seen as the process of transmitting accumulated knowledge from one generation 
  to the next. This process helps the student to function in society as a regular 
  citizen.[4][23][2] More person-centered definitions focus on the well-being of
   the student instead. For them, education is a process that helps them lead a 
   good life or the life they wish to lead.[4][22][2] Various scholars stress
    critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination.[20][21][24] 
    For them, mere indoctrination is only interested in instilling beliefs in 
    the student, independent of whether they are rational.[20][19] Education, 
    on the other hand, should also foster the rational ability to critically 
    reflect on those beliefs and question them.[25] But some theorists contend 
    that some forms of indoctrination may be necessary in the early stages of 
    education. It may be needed until the child's mind is sufficiently developed.
